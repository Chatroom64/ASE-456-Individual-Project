# David-Michael's Milestones
---
# Weekly
- Check in with team members and team leader
- Update progress log
- If no changes were pushed to the repo, push them by the end of the week
---
# Week 1 (9/8–9/14):
- Implement Sort By Genre feature
- Ensure that the titles are listed in alphabetical order within each Genre list
- Assist any team member who requests it
---
# Week 2 (9/15–9/21):
- Implement Search feature
- Allow the user to filter their search by such criteria: 
  - Relevance   
  - Highest Rated
  - Lowest Rated
  - Release Date
  - Alphabetical Order
  - Reverse Alphabetical Order
- This list may be shortened or expanded on at the team's discretion.
---
# Week 3 (9/22–9/28):
- Finalize the Search feature
- I expect the Search feature to take the longest of my requirements, so I expect to dedicate these two weeks to it.
- Assist any team member who requests it
---
# Week 4 (9/29–10/5):
- Stylize the application:
  - Discuss the graphic design and page layout
  - Ensure that every page follows that design
  - Experiment with designs! We may change our minds on how the app looks when we're no longer focused on the functional design
---
# Week 5 (10/6–10/13):
- Finalize EVERYTHING
- The goal is that very little work takes place this week. The sooner this gets completed and shipped, the better.
